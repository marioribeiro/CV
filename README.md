I'm a Full Stack Developer and former Head of Product and Technology. I have recently graduated from Makers Academy, where I received the intensive training and guidance to level up my coding skills and seek a career as a software developer. I am a passionate and committed individual with significant e-commerce experience from high-profile and luxury marketplaces and retailers. Creative and driven, whilst strategic and analytical, with many transferable skills gained within growing businesses. I have strong business astuteness and a sharp eye for design, and I work at pace with solid organisational skills, managing deadlines and stakeholders with enthusiasm and effectiveness.
